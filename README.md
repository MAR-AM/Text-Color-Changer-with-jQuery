# Text-Color-Changer-with-jQuery
This HTML document provides a simple interface to change the color of a text using jQuery. It includes a heading, a paragraph of text, and three buttons labeled "Rouge", "Vert", and "Bleu". 
 Each button changes the color of the text to red, green, or blue, respectively, when clicked. The jQuery script handles the click events for each button and applies the corresponding color to the paragraph text. The page is styled with basic CSS to center-align the content and style the buttons for a better user experience.
